## Features

- Chat can be sent to a set radius of the player using proximity channel.
- Select your channel with `/channel global` or `/channel prox`. Your later message will be sent into the selected channel.
- If you're in the global chat, you can quickly send a proximity message by adding `# ` (a hash and 1 space) in front of your message. Eg: `# Is anyone around me?`.
- Set your proximity radius with `/radius <radius>`. Eg: `/radius 50`.
