# Leaves Always Falling

Make every leaf spawn leaf particles constantly, regardless of the season. — Who doesn't love a dramatic effect?

You can also adjust the frequency of particle spawning with [ModMenu](https://github.com/Turnip-Labs/ModMenu)!

1. Open the mod menu
2. Select "Leaves Always Falling" mod from the left
3. Click at ⚙️ icon on the right
4. Adjust the "Leaves Falling Percentage" to the value you want (my personal favorite is 10%)

> **Important**
> Required [Babric](https://github.com/Turnip-Labs/babric-instance-repo/releases) to run the mod.
