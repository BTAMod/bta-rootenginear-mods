## FAQ

### Server?

**Yes**, you can use the sort chest mod on a server. However, the item might jump for a while after sorting because the
mod will emulate mouse clicks rather than directly changing the inventory data.

### How does the sort chest mod sort items?

Items are sorted by their item ID (ascending), followed by its metadata (like wool color code, ascending), and finally
by its stack size (descending).

### Rebind keys?

1. Open the mod menu (from [ModMenu](https://github.com/Turnip-Labs/ModMenu) mod)
2. Select "Sort Chest" mod from the left
3. Click at ⚙️ icon on the right
4. Rebind keys that you want
